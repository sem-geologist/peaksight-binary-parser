next
* make continous byte strings under data a new type "lazy_data" which collects global pointer
  position/offset and size and makes it possible to implement lazy parser in the target
  language
* add net instensity instance to calib files
* struct version update (now parsing files from PS 6.5)
* fix bug with reading reverse xtal abbrv
* restricted making of combi string only for signals of WDS type
* added enum for xray_lines
* element is parsed no more into u4 but to element_t type,
  That tyoe parses element into attribute atom_number (u4);
  element_name and other attributes can be added this way easier in the target language.
* Changed few attribute names to less verboise shorter names:
  dataset_items -> items
  sxf_header -> header
  sxf_main -> contents
* fixed wds_extra_flag, which is actually not a flag but a number of changes;
  in some wdsDat files file changes are not noted in global file changes scope, but per item
  and dataset.
* sanitized and unified datetime_and_pos attributes to be consistent in-between diferent type
  of files (qtiDat, wdsDat, impDat, qtiSet)
